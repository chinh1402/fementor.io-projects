pixel perfect? Yes

Idea: use setState to submitted / setSubmitted, don't have to use form due to how simple this design is. 

Ideal plan: Make both of the UI, each one has its own component, let the page render each of them. Use submitted / setSubmitted to re-render

Steps:
0. Measure the UIs
1. Make both UI
2. Each one has its own component, so create 2 components, render each accordingly
3. use submitted / setSubmitted to re-render
